    <strong>Heads up! Read the following, it is very important for your and other's health!</strong>
</p>
<h3>
   Laser Classification:
</h3>
<p>
    Your laser engraver is classified as a class 1 laser product according to IEC60825. This means that no
	harmful laser light can emit the safety housing while operating as purposed. 
	The laserhead inside features a 450nm laser diode with an output power greater than 1000mW.
    According to IEC60825 this is a class 4 laser which is capable of causing injury to both
    the eye and skin and will also present a fire hazard if sufficiently high output powers are used.

	Damaged or modified devices are not allowed to use. Ask a certified service engineer to repair them immediately.<br/>
	Be <strong>always</strong> responsible regarding yourself and others.<br/>
    <strong>Never</strong> leave the device unattended during operation. <br/>
    <strong>Never</strong> run the device without proper exhaust system. <br/>
    <strong>Always</strong> vent unfiltered fumes during operation to the outside. <br/>
    In closed rooms it is <strong>always</strong> necessary to filter the exhausted air. <br/>
    <strong>Never</strong> put reflecting or mirroring or flammable materials under the laser.<br/>
    <strong>Never</strong> put the machine on a flammable surface. <br/>
    It must be operated <strong>only</strong> by persons who are aware of the risks and dangers of the operation.<br/>
    If not operated by yourself, introduce the operating person carefully and responsibly.<br/>
    If you are connecting the laser engraver to a network ensure that you properly set up the network access
