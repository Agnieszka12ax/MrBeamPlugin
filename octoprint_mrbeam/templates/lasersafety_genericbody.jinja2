    <strong>Heads up! Read the following, it is very important for your and other's health!</strong>
</p>
<h3>
   Laser Classification:
</h3>
<p>
    Your lasercutter is classified as a Class 1 laser product according to IEC60825. This means that no
	harmful laser light can emit the safety housing while operating as purposed.
	The laserhead inside features a 450nm laser diode with an output power greater than 1000mW.
    According to IEC60825 this is a class 4 laser which is capable of causing injury to both
    the eye and skin and will also present a fire hazard if sufficiently high output powers are used.

<h3>Safety Advisory:</h3>
<p>
	Keep the safety housing and the safety lid <strong>always</strong> in excellent condition.<br/>
	<strong>Never</strong> modify, disable or circumvent the safety housing, safety lid, safety switches or any other safety related device on your lasercutter.<br/>
	Damaged or modified devices are not allowed to use. Ask a certified service engineer to repair them immediately.<br/>
	Be <strong>always</strong> responsible regarding yourself and others.<br/>
    <strong>Never</strong> leave the device unattended during operation. <br/>
    <strong>Never</strong> run the device without proper exhaust system. <br/>
    <strong>Always</strong> vent unfiltered fumes during operation to the outside. <br/>
    In closed rooms it is <strong>always</strong> necessary to filter the exhausted air. <br/>
    <strong>Never</strong> put reflecting or mirroring or flammable materials under the laser.<br/>
    <strong>Never</strong> put the machine on a flammable surface. <br/>
    It must be operated <strong>only</strong> by persons who are aware of the risks and dangers of the operation.<br/>
    If not operated by yourself, introduce the operating person carefully and responsibly.<br/>
    If you are connecting the lasercutter to a network ensure that you properly set up the network access
    as well as the machines access control.
	Do NOT underestimate the risk of an unsecured access from the internet to your lasercutter.
